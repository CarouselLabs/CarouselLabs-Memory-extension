# MemLoop Chrome Extension üîÑ

**MemLoop keeps your conversations in sync. No more repeating yourself‚Äîjust seamless AI collaboration!**

MemLoop is a Chrome browser extension that acts as your personal, persistent memory across various AI chat platforms. It solves the problem of limited context windows by creating a searchable, personal knowledge base from your most important interactions.

## Key Features

-   **üß† Persistent Memory:** Creates a long-term, searchable memory layer for your AI interactions.
-   **üåê Multi-Platform Support:** Integrates with a wide range of popular AI chat services like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and more.
-   **üöÄ Contextual Assistance:** Automatically surfaces relevant past memories in a convenient sidebar right next to your current chat, streamlining your workflow.
-   **üîí Secure & Private:** Your memories are securely stored in a dedicated backend service, and all communication is handled over authenticated APIs.
-   **‚úÖ User-Controlled:** You decide exactly what to save.

## How It Works

1.  **Save Memories:** Use the context menu or buttons injected into AI chat interfaces to save important snippets of conversation, code, or ideas.
2.  **Seamless Recall:** When you start a new chat, MemLoop automatically searches your memory base for relevant information.
3.  **Sidebar Integration:** View, search, and manage your memories in the sidebar without leaving your current tab.

## For Developers

### Architecture

-   **Manifest V3:** Built on the modern Chrome extension platform.
-   **Service Worker:** Handles background tasks like authentication and event listeners.
-   **ES Modules:** Uses modern JavaScript modules throughout.
-   **Dynamic Configuration:** Loads authentication configuration in this priority order:
    1.  User overrides from the Settings page (`chrome.storage.sync`).
    2.  Baked-in defaults from `config/auth.defaults.json`.
    3.  Dynamic discovery from the backend gateway.
    4.  Hardcoded fallback URLs.
-   **Authentication:** Uses **Cognito OAuth 2.0 with PKCE** via the `chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` API for a secure sign-in process.
